# Apicius

Apicius is a recipy app with the sole difference that everything is stored localy with a clean UI. In other words, it is an app made thinking about me for you :)

## Quick Start

```bash
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the app
npm start

# Build the app (run command and the click on the .dmg file inside the dist app)
npm run dist
```

## Fun Fact

[Apicius cookbook](https://www.gutenberg.org/files/29728/29728-h/29728-h.htm)  is the oldest recipe cookbook that we still have the recipies for. Might be a good place for you to get inspiration from.
